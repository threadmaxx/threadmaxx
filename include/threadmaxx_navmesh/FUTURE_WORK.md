# `threadmaxx_navmesh` — batch plan

Sibling-library implementation plan. `DESIGN_NOTES.md` is the
authoritative spec; this doc breaks it down into shippable
test-driven batches.

Status: **N8 shipped (2026-06-10)** — `ObstacleOverlay` + `DynamicObstacle`
back a spatial-hash overlay; `PathRequest::obstacles` makes the solver
skip neighbor polys whose centroid sits inside any blocker for the
matching area tag. Header-only spatial hash in
`detail/spatial_hash.hpp`; PImpl'd public surface in `obstacle.hpp` +
`src/ObstacleOverlay.cpp`. Green on `build/` (238/238) and
`build-werror/` (23/23 navmesh). N9 remains 📋 planned. Sequencing
follows the §10 "implementation order" of the design notes, regrouped
into shippable units that each carry their own tests.

## Conventions

Each batch is independently shippable:

- **Goal** — what the batch accomplishes in one sentence.
- **Test gate** — assertions that prove the batch landed.
- **Files** — what's added / modified.
- **Risks** — what could break.
- **Out of scope** — explicitly deferred to a later batch.

Batches start red, go green, then refactor. The library produces a
static library `threadmaxx::navmesh` plus public headers under
`include/threadmaxx_navmesh/`. The runtime is header-light but
A* / funnel / bake have enough state to warrant `.cpp` files.

Query throughput is the perf invariant: batch path solving must
amortize down to roughly one A* per worker job at scale.

## Batch N1 — Foundations (registry + mesh load) — ✅ shipped 2026-06-09

**Goal**: load a pre-baked navmesh blob into the registry,
hand back a `NavMeshRef`. No queries yet — just the data model.

**Test gate**:

- `test_navmesh_registry_load` — load a known-good 16-polygon
  flat-square test mesh; `meta()` returns expected polygon/tile
  counts; `isValid` returns true for the returned ref.
- `test_navmesh_registry_unload` — `unload` invalidates the ref;
  reload allocates a fresh generation.
- `test_navmesh_registry_invalid` — load a corrupted blob (wrong
  magic, truncated tile data) returns an invalid ref with a clear
  diagnostic.

**Files**: `types.hpp`, `mesh.hpp`, `config.hpp`, umbrella header,
`src/NavMeshRegistry.cpp`, three tests + a baked-mesh fixture
generator helper (lives under `tests/navmesh/fixtures/`).

**Risks**: locking in the binary format too early. Recommendation:
ship a v1 format with `magic + version + tile count + per-tile
{header, vertices, polygons, adjacency}`, and reject any other
version on load — same discipline as the engine's WorldSnapshot.

**Out of scope**: A* (N3), tile-based streaming (deferred to v1.x).

## Batch N2 — Tile model + adjacency — ✅ shipped 2026-06-09

**Goal**: per-tile polygon storage with adjacency + portal edges +
area cost tags. Internal — exposed only through `NavMesh` const
accessors. The fixture mesh from N1 grows from a single square to
4 tiles arranged in an L-shape.

**Test gate** (delivered):

- `test_navmesh_tile_adjacency` — every interior edge has a
  reciprocal portal; every L-shape boundary edge resolves to neither
  intra-tile neighbor nor cross-tile portal; `portalsForTile` counts
  per-tile portal incidence.
- `test_navmesh_tile_traversal` — a hand-written BFS walker seeded
  from every `(tile, poly)` in the L-shape reaches all 16 polygons
  across 4 tiles.

**Shipped**:

- `NavPortal` POD + `NavMesh::portals()` / `tileIndex()` /
  `portalsForTile()` / `crossTileNeighbor()` accessors.
- `NavMeshLoadError::{InvalidPortalCount, InvalidPortal}` diagnostics.
- v2 wire format (appends `[portalCount u32][NavPortal * N]`); v1
  blobs no longer load (rejected as UnsupportedVersion).
- `kNavMeshMaxPortals = 1 << 20` cap.
- `detail/bitset.hpp` (walker scratch storage; ready for N3 A*).
- `tests/navmesh/fixtures/blob_builder.hpp::make4TileLShape` —
  canonical L-shape with 6 portals.

**Out of scope**: streaming load (v1.x), tile-level invalidation
during edits (v1.x).

## Batch N3 — Single-path A* over polygon adjacency — ✅ shipped 2026-06-09

**Goal**: synchronous path query. `request()` returns a `PathId`,
`tryGet()` returns a ready `PathResult` on the same tick (because the
solve is synchronous in v1.0).

**Test gate** (delivered):

- `test_navmesh_astar_simple` — request a path across the L-shape
  fixture from T0 corner to T3 corner; corridor size = 7 polys, cost
  = 6.0, waypoints `[start, edge-midpoints×6, goal]`. Same-poly query
  degenerates to cost 0 + waypoints `[start, goal]`. `cancel` / `clear`
  / `tryGet(unknown)` round-trip correctly.
- `test_navmesh_astar_unreachable` — two-islands fixture, no portals;
  `allowPartial == false` → `success == false`, empty corridor /
  waypoints. Off-mesh start / goal + invalid ref each fail pre-solve
  via `lastRequestStatus()`.
- `test_navmesh_astar_partial` — same fixture with `allowPartial ==
  true`: success=true, partial=true, corridor ends at the in-T0
  polygon with smallest heuristic to the goal (T0:1, the +x neighbor).
  Last waypoint anchors on that poly's centroid.
- `test_navmesh_astar_area_mask` — 3×2 strip fixture with poly 1
  tagged area 1 (water). All-mask: corridor `[0,1,2]` cost 2.0.
  Mask `~(1<<1)`: corridor `[0,3,4,5,2]` cost 4.0.

**Shipped**:

- `query.hpp` — `PathRequest` / `PathResult` (with `corridor` +
  `partial`) / `PathQueryService` / `PathRequestStatus`.
- `detail/a_star.hpp` — `NodeIndex` (tile-prefix-sum encode/decode),
  `AStarOpenSet` (binary min-heap with lazy-decrement skip), reusable
  `AStarState` scratch.
- `src/PathQueryService.cpp` — synchronous solver: even-odd XZ
  point-in-polygon locate, centroid-cost edges, euclidean heuristic,
  area-mask filter, best-h fallback for partial, edge-midpoint
  waypoint reconstruction (handles intra-tile + cross-tile portals).
- Fixtures: `makeTwoDisconnectedTiles` (no portals — unreachable +
  partial) and `makeAreaMaskStrip` (3×2 grid, poly 1 = water tag 1).
- `Vec3` heuristic + cost are reused from the engine's `Components.hpp`
  so the library still has zero new math dependencies.

**Out of scope**: funnel smoothing (N4), async queries (N5).

## Batch N4 — Funnel smoothing — ✅ shipped 2026-06-10

**Goal**: convert the polygon-corridor output of A* into a
waypoint list via the Simple Stupid Funnel algorithm. Drops the
zig-zag that polygon-center routes produce.

**Test gate** (delivered):

- `test_navmesh_funnel_straight` — straight-line corridor across
  the 16-poly flat square (4 polys, cost 3.0) smooths to `[start,
  goal]`.
- `test_navmesh_funnel_corner` — hand-built L-shaped portal
  sequence drives `stringPullFunnel` directly. Asymmetric goal
  forces a pinch at the inner corner; expected output
  `[start, (1, 0, 1), goal]`. Also covers a straight 2-portal
  subcase. Direct unit test bypasses A* so the assertion is
  independent of tiebreaker.
- `test_navmesh_funnel_pinch` — area-mask strip with water
  masked: corridor `[0, 3, 4, 5, 2]` (cost 4.0) smooths to
  `[start, (1, 0, 1), (2, 0, 1), goal]` — two corner pinches
  bracketing the bypass.

**Shipped**:

- `detail/funnel.hpp` — header-only Simple Stupid Funnel
  implementation. `FunnelPortal {left, right}` POD,
  `cross2D` / `vequalXZ` helpers, `stringPullFunnel(portals, out)`
  entry point. Uses standard CCW-positive cross product
  (`(b.x-a.x)*(c.z-a.z) - (c.x-a.x)*(b.z-a.z)`); portal
  convention `LEFT = v[(e+1) % n], RIGHT = v[e]` matches our
  CCW-from-above polygons. Always emits `[start, end]` (the
  `size() == 1` guard handles same-poly degeneracy) and dedups a
  pinch-at-goal corner so the final waypoint is never duplicated.
- `src/PathQueryService.cpp` — `request()` now builds the portal
  sequence from the A* corridor (start/end portals book-ending
  inter-poly portals, each derived via `findEdgeTo` + the FROM
  poly's vertex order) and runs `stringPullFunnel` into
  `result.waypoints`. The polygon `corridor` shape is unchanged
  from N3.
- `Impl::portalBuf` — reused scratch vector, preserves capacity
  across solves.

**Note on the v1.0 contract**: `waypoints` is now the smoothed
walking path. Pre-N4 callers that relied on the edge-midpoint
spacing of v0.x must compute their own midpoints from `corridor`.
The existing N3 tests were updated in the same batch: the
L-shape "simple" test now asserts the loose contract
`2 ≤ waypoints.size() ≤ corridor.size() + 1` since funnel output
depends on which equal-cost corridor A* picked.

**Files**: `include/threadmaxx_navmesh/detail/funnel.hpp` (new),
`src/threadmaxx_navmesh/PathQueryService.cpp` (modified),
`tests/navmesh/test_navmesh_funnel_*.cpp` (3 new), three N3
tests updated for the smoothed-waypoints contract,
`include/threadmaxx_navmesh/threadmaxx_navmesh.hpp` unchanged
(the umbrella already pulled `query.hpp`).

**Out of scope**: agent-radius-aware path corridor shrinking (N7).

## Batch N5 — Async path query service — ✅ shipped 2026-06-10

**Goal**: convert the synchronous N3 service to a worker-thread
queue. `request()` enqueues; the service drains on its own thread;
`tryGet()` returns `nullopt` until ready.

**Test gate** (delivered):

- `test_navmesh_query_async_smoke` — 100 requests fanning out over
  the 16-poly flat square; each async result matches the reference
  produced by a fresh `PathQueryService` in synchronous mode
  (`workerThreads == 0`). After draining, `pendingCount == 0` and
  `storedCount == 100`.
- `test_navmesh_query_cancel` — three cases: cancel a freshly-issued
  id before the worker pops it (`wait()` returns nullopt); cancel
  the last of 64 queued ids (the rest still complete successfully);
  cancel an already-stored id (`tryGet()` returns nullopt). Cancel
  on an unknown id is a no-op.
- `test_navmesh_query_clear` — queue 64 requests, call `clear()`,
  verify `pendingCount == 0`, `storedCount == 0`, every prior id
  returns nullopt from both `tryGet()` and `wait()` (the latter
  resolves fast via tombstone — no timeout). Fresh requests after
  `clear()` resolve normally.

**Shipped**:

- `query.hpp` — `PathQueryServiceConfig { workerThreads = 1 }`,
  `wait(id, timeout)`, `pendingCount()`, `workerCount()`. Move ctor
  / assignment disabled (worker threads + condvars make a sound
  relocation awkward and unnecessary in practice). `Config{0}` is
  the synchronous mode kept for testing + sync-style callers.
- `src/PathQueryService.cpp` — `solvePrepared()` helper factored
  out of `request()`; per-worker `SolverScratch` (A* state + node
  index + centroids + funnel portal buf). Internal worker loop:
  pop, cancellation check, mesh resolve, unlock, solve, re-lock,
  in-flight removal + cancellation re-check, store. Tombstones via
  `cancelled` set cover three windows: cancel-while-queued (popped
  worker drops), cancel-during-solve (post-solve check drops),
  `clear()` against in-flight (tracked via `inFlight` set).
- Existing N3/N4 tests migrated from `svc.tryGet(id)` immediately
  after `svc.request(req)` to `svc.wait(id, seconds{5})` — one-line
  change per call site (6 tests, 9 sites). The terminal
  `tryGet`s that assert "unknown id returns nullopt" stay
  unchanged.

**Files**: `include/threadmaxx_navmesh/query.hpp` (modified),
`src/threadmaxx_navmesh/PathQueryService.cpp` (modified),
`tests/navmesh/test_navmesh_query_async_smoke.cpp`,
`tests/navmesh/test_navmesh_query_cancel.cpp`,
`tests/navmesh/test_navmesh_query_clear.cpp` (new),
`tests/navmesh/CMakeLists.txt` (modified), six N3/N4 tests migrated
from `tryGet` → `wait`.

**Engine integration**: the service spawns its own thread (default
1 worker). The sibling library remains zero-coupled to engine
internals — borrowing from the engine's `JobSystem` would have
required exposing that header out of `src/`, which is out of
scope for v1.0. N6's `BatchPathSolver` can revisit thread-pool
sharing if profiling shows two pools fighting for cores.

**Out of scope**: batch solver (N6).

## Batch N6 — Batch path solver — ✅ shipped 2026-06-10

**Goal**: `BatchPathSolver::solve(BatchPathRequest)` for "100 NPCs
all asking at once" cases. Internally parallelizes via a persistent
worker pool of the same shape as N5 (per-worker scratch, condvar
wake, atomic next-index dispatch); not literally sharing
`PathQueryService`'s pool because the two services have independent
lifetimes and the sibling lib stays decoupled from internal sharing
contracts.

**Test gate** (delivered):

- `test_navmesh_batch_correctness` — 64 (start, goal) pairs solved
  via batch (2 workers); each entry matches the result a fresh
  synchronous `PathQueryService` produced for the same input. Also
  pins the empty-batch fast path and the `workerThreads == 0`
  in-line mode.
- `test_navmesh_batch_determinism` — same input batch solved
  back-to-back on one instance, then on a fresh 2-worker instance,
  then on a 4-worker instance: byte-identical `cost`, `corridor`,
  `waypoints` across all three runs. Determinism is structural —
  each request is solved end-to-end on one worker scratch, so the
  worker schedule never affects per-index output.
- `bench/navmesh_batch_bench` — 1000 requests on a 16x16 (256-poly)
  flat grid. Measured: 57k qps (sync), 116k (1 worker), 166k (2),
  251k (4), 287k (8) on this box. Well above the v1.0 close-out
  gate of ≥10k qps on a 256-poly mesh @ 4 workers. `--grid=N`
  / `--requests=N` flags let the bench scale further.

**Shipped**:

- `include/threadmaxx_navmesh/crowd.hpp` — `BatchPathRequest`,
  `BatchPathResult`, `BatchPathSolverConfig { workerThreads = 1 }`,
  `BatchPathSolver` (non-movable, owns persistent worker pool).
  `solve()` blocks until every entry has a result; the producer
  thread participates so effective parallelism is
  `workerThreads + 1`. Empty batch is a fast-path no-op.
  `workerThreads == 0` runs every solve inline on the producer.
- `include/threadmaxx_navmesh/detail/solver.hpp` +
  `src/threadmaxx_navmesh/Solver.cpp` — extracted the shared solver
  internals (`PolyLocation`, `SolverScratch`, `PreparedRequest`,
  `locate()`, `solvePrepared()`) out of the N5 anonymous namespace
  so both `PathQueryService` and `BatchPathSolver` consume one
  tested A* + funnel pipeline. PathQueryService.cpp is now ~210
  lines (down from ~547) and contains only the async-queue
  machinery; correctness logic moved verbatim into Solver.cpp.
- `src/threadmaxx_navmesh/BatchPathSolver.cpp` — persistent worker
  pool with per-batch generation counter (`batchGen`), atomic
  `nextIndex` work-steal dispatch, atomic `doneCount` barrier. The
  producer publishes the batch under `mtx`, notifies all workers,
  joins the work loop itself, then waits on `doneCv` until every
  worker bumps `doneCount`. Worker scratch is per-thread, recycled
  across batches.
- Umbrella `threadmaxx_navmesh.hpp` now re-exports `crowd.hpp`.

**Files**: `crowd.hpp`, `detail/solver.hpp` (new),
`src/Solver.cpp` (new — extracted from PathQueryService),
`src/PathQueryService.cpp` (refactored to use detail/solver.hpp),
`src/BatchPathSolver.cpp` (new), `src/CMakeLists.txt` (new sources +
header), `bench/navmesh_batch_bench.cpp` (new),
`bench/CMakeLists.txt` (new opt-in target),
`tests/navmesh/test_navmesh_batch_correctness.cpp` (new),
`tests/navmesh/test_navmesh_batch_determinism.cpp` (new),
`tests/navmesh/CMakeLists.txt` (modified).

**Out of scope**: agent steering (N7).

## Batch N7 — Steering + corridor following — ✅ shipped 2026-06-10

**Goal**: `followPath` turns a waypoint list + agent state into a
`desiredVelocity`. Used by game-side movement to actually
navigate the path.

**Test gate** (delivered):

- `test_navmesh_follow_straight` — agent on a single +x segment
  with zero initial velocity. The first call lifts speed by exactly
  `maxAcceleration*dt` along +x; iterated 100 ticks at `maxSpeed=4`,
  `maxAccel=20`, `dt=1/60` the speed saturates at `maxSpeed` and
  the direction stays `(1, 0, 0)`. Also pins the acceleration cap:
  `|Δv| ≤ maxAcceleration*dt` on every step.
- `test_navmesh_follow_corner` — L-shaped corridor (10m +x, then
  10m +z). Sim across the corner up to 1200 ticks; at every step
  the angle between consecutive `desiredVelocity` vectors stays
  within `1.5 × asin(maxAccel*dt / maxSpeed)` (the steady-state
  angular bound, with safety margin to absorb the speed dip at the
  corner). Also asserts the segment cursor advances past the
  corner and the agent eventually reaches `finished`.
- `test_navmesh_follow_finished` — four cases: on-the-goal flips
  `finished = true` with zero output velocity; XZ distance under
  `arrivalRadius` (with non-trivial y offset) reports finished
  too; outside the radius reports finished false with a non-zero
  steering velocity; a degenerate single-waypoint corridor reports
  finished unconditionally.

**Shipped**:

- `include/threadmaxx_navmesh/steering.hpp` — header-only N7
  surface. `FollowPathInput { corridor (span<const Vec3>),
  currentPosition, currentVelocity, maxSpeed, maxAcceleration,
  arrivalRadius, dt, segmentIndex }`; `FollowPathOutput
  { desiredVelocity, nextTarget, segmentIndex, finished }`;
  `followPath(in) -> out` pure function. The model is
  acceleration-limited: desired velocity = unit-direction-to-target
  * maxSpeed, then the per-tick velocity delta is clamped to
  `maxAcceleration * dt`. At steady state this caps the angular
  rate at `maxAcceleration / maxSpeed`. The segment cursor is
  caller-persisted; the function walks it forward whenever the
  agent's projection onto the current segment passes `t == 1`.
  Steering is XZ-planar — y is ignored on input, forced to 0 on
  output. Arrival is a straight XZ-distance check against
  `arrivalRadius`; passing flips `finished` and zeros the output
  velocity. The function takes no locks, allocates nothing, and
  is safe to call concurrently from any thread.
- Umbrella header now re-exports `steering.hpp`.

**Files**: `include/threadmaxx_navmesh/steering.hpp` (new),
`include/threadmaxx_navmesh/threadmaxx_navmesh.hpp` (modified),
`tests/navmesh/test_navmesh_follow_straight.cpp`,
`test_navmesh_follow_corner.cpp`, `test_navmesh_follow_finished.cpp`
(new), `tests/navmesh/CMakeLists.txt` (modified).

**Out of scope**: local avoidance / RVO (v1.x), crowd density
fields (v1.x), agent-radius-aware corridor shrink (v1.x).

## Batch N8 — Dynamic obstacle overlay ✅ shipped 2026-06-10

**Delivered**:
- `DynamicObstacle { center, halfExtents, height, areaMask }` POD.
  `areaMask` bit `k` blocks polygons tagged `areaTag == k` (default
  `0xFFFFFFFFu` blocks every area tag). `height` is reserved for
  v1.x 3D queries — the runtime treats the obstacle as an XZ
  rectangle.
- `ObstacleOverlay` — PImpl'd public surface (`obstacle.hpp` +
  `src/ObstacleOverlay.cpp`). `add(o) -> ObstacleId`, `update(id,
  o)`, `remove(id)`, `isBlocked(xz, callerMask)`. Ids strictly
  monotonic; never reused. `update()` rebuilds the obstacle's
  spatial-hash buckets atomically (no transient ghost cells).
- `detail/spatial_hash.hpp` — header-only generic XZ spatial hash
  (`SpatialHashXZ<KeyT, ValueT>`). Floor-to-negative-infinity cell
  math handles obstacles straddling the origin without bias. The
  overlay buckets each obstacle by its XZ AABB; `isBlocked()` does
  the precise AABB-vs-point test on the matched cell's payloads.
- `PathRequest::obstacles` — optional `const ObstacleOverlay*` the
  solver consults during edge expansion. Skip rule: `if obstacles
  && obstacles->isBlocked(centroid[neighbor], 1 << nbrPoly.areaTag)`
  → drop the neighbor. Null overlay path is the original behavior;
  no measurable cost for legacy callers.
- `Config::cellSize` defaults to `1.0f` per the DESIGN_NOTES
  recommendation; callers should reach for
  `max(agentRadius, tileSize/8)` when they have those numbers.

**Test outcomes**:
- `test_navmesh_obstacle_blocks` — wall bisecting the middle row of
  the 16-poly flat square forces the path off the direct (cost 3.0,
  4 polys) route onto the detour (cost 5.0, 6 polys), then dropping
  the overlay restores the direct path.
- `test_navmesh_obstacle_update` — moving the same obstacle to a
  far corner restores the direct path; moving it to the upper row
  keeps the direct path optimal (it never used the upper row).
- `test_navmesh_obstacle_remove` — remove the wall and the direct
  path returns. Stale `remove()` is a silent no-op; a fresh id is
  unaffected by stale removes.
- Green on `build/` (238/238) and `build-werror/` (23/23 navmesh).

**Files**: `include/threadmaxx_navmesh/obstacle.hpp` (new),
`include/threadmaxx_navmesh/detail/spatial_hash.hpp` (new),
`src/threadmaxx_navmesh/ObstacleOverlay.cpp` (new),
`include/threadmaxx_navmesh/query.hpp` (modified — `PathRequest::obstacles`),
`src/threadmaxx_navmesh/Solver.cpp` (modified — edge-expansion gate),
`include/threadmaxx_navmesh/threadmaxx_navmesh.hpp` (modified — umbrella),
`src/threadmaxx_navmesh/CMakeLists.txt` (modified),
`tests/navmesh/test_navmesh_obstacle_blocks.cpp`,
`test_navmesh_obstacle_update.cpp`,
`test_navmesh_obstacle_remove.cpp` (new),
`tests/navmesh/CMakeLists.txt` (modified).

**Out of scope**: full local-avoidance steering against dynamic
obstacles (v1.x); segment-vs-AABB edge sweep (centroid test is the
v1.0 contract); 3D queries against `halfExtents.y` (v1.x).

## Batch N9 — Bake tool

**Goal**: an offline executable that consumes triangle mesh input
+ bake parameters and produces the v1 baked-blob format. Lives in
its own CMake target (`threadmaxx_navmesh_bake`), not linked into
the runtime library.

**Test gate**:

- `test_navmesh_bake_smoke` — bake a known-good triangle soup
  (10 quads forming the L-shape) and validate the runtime can
  load the result.
- `test_navmesh_bake_validation` — bake input with non-manifold
  geometry returns a validation error, not a runtime crash.
- `test_navmesh_bake_areas` — bake input with per-triangle area
  tags preserves them in the baked output; A* sees them.

**Files**: `bake.hpp`, `src/BakeTool.cpp`,
`examples/navmesh_bake/main.cpp` (the executable).

**Risks**: voxel-based bake (Recast-style) is the right algorithm
but a big implementation effort. Recommendation for v1.0: ship a
**triangle-direct** bake that assumes input geometry is already
planar and walkable, with explicit per-triangle area tags. Real
Recast-style voxelization is a v1.x candidate.

**Out of scope**: heightfield voxelization, automatic walkability
classification, mesh simplification (all v1.x).

## v1.0 close-out criteria

- ✓ Every batch N1–N9 landed and tested.
- ✓ End-to-end: bake a hand-authored level → load → solve paths
  for 100 agents → follow paths to completion.
- ✓ Bench `navmesh_batch_bench.cpp` reports ≥10k path queries / sec
  on a 256-poly mesh, 4 workers.
- ✓ Docs: README, USER_GUIDE, MAINTAINER_GUIDE.
- ✓ ctest 100% on `build/` and `build-werror/`.
- ✓ Version stamped at 1.0.0 in
  `include/threadmaxx_navmesh/version.hpp`.

## v1.x candidate batches (not blocking v1.0)

### v1.x — Voxelized bake (Recast-style)

Heightfield voxelization → walkable-surface classification →
polygon extraction. The "real" bake. Standard algorithm,
multi-page implementation.

### v1.x — Tile streaming

Load/unload individual tiles at runtime. Required for large worlds
(>1km²). Depends on the registry handling partial mesh state
gracefully.

### v1.x — Local avoidance (RVO)

Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles for crowd-density agent-vs-agent
avoidance. Distinct from the N8 dynamic-obstacle overlay (which
handles static-ish blockers, not other agents).

### v1.x — Path corridor with agent radius

Currently the funnel walks polygon edges. With agent radius, the
funnel should pull in by the radius — gives more realistic paths
that don't clip walls. Bolt on after a real game's pathing reveals
the visual problem.

### v1.x — Off-mesh links

Jumps, teleporters, ladders. The bake format already reserves a
slot for them; runtime A* needs to traverse them.

### v1.x — Connectivity / reachability queries

`reachable(start, goal)` (cheaper than full path solve, just a
DFS over portal adjacency). Useful for AI "can I path to player?"
checks that don't need the actual route.

### v1.x — Region / island analysis

Disconnected-component analysis baked into the mesh metadata so
runtime reachability is a constant-time mask check.

## Out of scope for the whole library

Per DESIGN_NOTES §1 — none of this lands at any batch:

- Rigid body / collision physics
- Collision resolution authority
- Animation IK
- Rendering
- Matchmaking / networking
- Editor UI
- ECS storage ownership
- Pathfinding baked into engine core
