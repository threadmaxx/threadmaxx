/// The engine calls @ref onFrame once per @ref Engine::step (on the
/// simulation thread, after the frame has been built and published) with
/// a finalized @ref FrameSnapshot. The sink owns any buffering and any
/// off-thread I/O; @ref onFrame must be **non-blocking and cheap** —
/// budget it at a few microseconds. Treat the snapshot as borrowed:
/// `snap.systems` is a span into engine-owned memory and is only valid
/// for the call's duration.
///
/// Install via @ref Engine::setTraceSink. The default is `nullptr`
/// (no sink, zero cost). The engine never takes ownership; the sink
/// must outlive the engine (mirror of `setRenderer` / `setLogger`).

/// §3.7 batch 14 — rolling Chrome-trace JSON sink.
///
/// Each call to @ref onFrame appends one `step` record and one record
/// per system in the snapshot. When the active file exceeds
/// @ref Config::rotationBytes the sink closes it (writing the closing
/// `]`), increments a rotation index, and opens the next file. Files
/// are standalone valid Chrome trace JSON; load any one of them in
/// `chrome://tracing` or Perfetto.
///
/// Path format: `pathTemplate` may contain `%N` which gets replaced
/// with the current rotation index. If no `%N` is present the sink
/// appends `.N.json` to the template. Examples:
///
///     "trace.%N.json"        → trace.0.json, trace.1.json, ...
///     "/var/log/trace"       → /var/log/trace.0.json, ...
///
/// All I/O happens on the sim thread inside @ref onFrame; the sink
/// is not async. If your `rotationBytes` is tiny and your tick
/// budget tight, prefer @ref HudTraceSink or a custom async sink.
///
/// @par Failure mode (clarified, §3.6.5 batch 15b)
///      If the path can't be opened (filesystem error, permission
///      denied, parent directory missing) the sink silently no-ops
///      its writes: subsequent `onFrame` calls do nothing and
///      @ref bytesWrittenCurrent stays at zero. The engine never
///      crashes on a bad path. Game code that needs failure
///      visibility should check `bytesWrittenCurrent()` after a few
///      ticks and react if it's still 0.
