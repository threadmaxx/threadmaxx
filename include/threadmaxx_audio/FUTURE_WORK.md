# `threadmaxx_audio` — batch plan

Sibling-library implementation plan. `DESIGN_NOTES.md` is the
authoritative spec; this doc breaks it down into shippable
test-driven batches.

Status: **v1.0.0 shipped (2026-06-11)** — all eight batches landed,
close-out gates green. Version stamped at `1.0.0` in
`include/threadmaxx_audio/version.hpp`.
Sequencing follows the §8 "implementation order" of the design notes,
regrouped into shippable units that each carry their own tests.

## Conventions

Each batch is independently shippable:

- **Goal** — what the batch accomplishes in one sentence.
- **Test gate** — assertions that prove the batch landed.
- **Files** — what's added / modified.
- **Risks** — what could break.
- **Out of scope** — explicitly deferred to a later batch.

Batches start red, go green, then refactor. The library produces a
static library `threadmaxx::audio` plus public headers under
`include/threadmaxx_audio/`. Platform backends live under
`src/threadmaxx_audio/backends/`.

The hot path (mixer callback) must never allocate. Tests prove this
by running the mix loop under a custom allocator that asserts on
allocation.

## Batch AU1 — Foundations (types + buffers + loopback device) ✅ landed 2026-06-10

**Goal**: header-only types, audio buffer primitives, and a
`LoopbackDevice` test backend that captures submitted mix buffers
for assertion. No mixer yet — just the data model + the device
contract being exercisable.

**Test gate** (all green on `build/` + `build-werror/`):

- ✅ `test_audio_buffer` — `AudioSpan` / `ConstAudioSpan` round-trip
  through frame-iteration; `framesToBytes(format, n)` is exact across
  mono / stereo / 5.1; `samplesIn` matches `frames × channels`.
- ✅ `test_audio_loopback_device` — initialize → submit 1024 frames of
  stereo silence → shutdown; captured buffer length matches input;
  format round-trips; post-shutdown submit is a silent drop;
  re-initialize succeeds with a different format; zero-channel and
  zero-frame initialize rejected.
- ✅ `test_audio_format` — channel layout to channel count mapping
  (Mono=1, Stereo=2, Quad=4, FiveOne=6, SevenOne=8, Ambisonic=4);
  `AudioFormat` and handle equality.

**Files landed**:
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/types.hpp` — handles + `ChannelLayout`
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/buffer.hpp` — `AudioFormat`,
  `AudioSpan`, `ConstAudioSpan`, `framesToBytes`, `samplesIn`
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/config.hpp` — `kDefaultSampleRate` /
  `kDefaultBufferFrames` / `kDefaultMaxVoices` / `kMaxSendsPerVoice`
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/device.hpp` — `IAudioDevice` interface
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/loopback_device.hpp` — `LoopbackDevice`
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/threadmaxx_audio.hpp` — umbrella
- `src/threadmaxx_audio/backends/LoopbackDevice.cpp` — impl
- `src/threadmaxx_audio/CMakeLists.txt` — static lib `threadmaxx::audio`
- `tests/audio/CMakeLists.txt` + three `test_audio_*.cpp`

**Resolved decisions**:
- Interleaved storage for `AudioSpan` (matches every real backend's
  submit format); planar conversions happen inside the DSP layer
  when needed.
- Ambisonic = first-order (4 channels W,X,Y,Z); higher-order is v1.x.
- LoopbackDevice silently drops post-shutdown submits and asserts on
  format/frame-count mismatches against initialize parameters.

**Out of scope**: actual mixing (AU2), real device backends (AU8).

## Batch AU2 — Bus graph + voice playback + mixing ✅ landed 2026-06-10

**Goal**: a usable mono/stereo mixer. Create buses, route voices
to buses, mix per-frame into the device. Voice allocator with
stealing policy.

**Test gate** (all green on `build/` + `build-werror/`):

- ✅ `test_audio_mixer_one_shot` — register a 1-second sine clip,
  `play()` returns a `VoiceId`, mix N frames; LoopbackDevice
  captures audible output above silence; non-looping voice
  auto-frees its slot at clip end.
- ✅ `test_audio_mixer_bus_routing` — voice routed to a muted bus
  produces silence; un-mute resumes audible output; -20dB bus
  gain attenuates by ~10×.
- ✅ `test_audio_mixer_solo` — soloing bus A silences bus B;
  soloing both restores full mix; un-soloing both returns to
  normal mix.
- ✅ `test_audio_mixer_voice_stealing` — exhausting the voice pool
  with `MaxVoices=8` plus a 9th play() steals the oldest;
  `MixerStats::droppedVoices` increments; stolen `VoiceId`
  decodes as stale; stopping a voice frees its slot without
  triggering steal.
- ✅ `test_audio_mixer_no_allocations` — under a tracking allocator
  (global `operator new` override), 100 mix-cycles after warmup
  produce zero allocations.

**Files landed**:
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/voice.hpp` — `BusDesc`, `VoiceDesc`,
  `VoiceState`
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/clip.hpp` — `Clip` POD (interleaved
  PCM)
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/mixer.hpp` — `AudioMixer`,
  `AudioMixerConfig`, `MixerStats`
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/detail/voice_allocator.hpp` —
  `VoiceAllocator` + `VoiceSlot`
- `src/threadmaxx_audio/AudioMixer.cpp`
- `src/threadmaxx_audio/VoiceAllocator.cpp`
- `LoopbackDevice` got `setCaptureEnabled()` /
  `droppedSubmits()` so the no-alloc test can suppress
  capture-time `emplace_back` after warmup
- five `tests/audio/test_audio_mixer_*.cpp`

**Resolved decisions**:
- Master bus is bus slot 0 — always alive, never destroyable,
  can carry gain/mute but not solo (it's the output node).
- Voice → bus routing falls back to master when the requested
  bus is `BusId{0}` or has been destroyed.
- Voice stealing picks the lowest-`startTick` slot (oldest);
  generation bump invalidates both the stolen `VoiceId` and any
  prior reference to the slot.
- Mono clip → stereo bus duplicates to L+R; matching counts copy
  through; mismatched counts down-mix to mono then fan out.
- `VoiceId` / `BusId` / `SoundId` encoding: low 32 bits = slot
  index, high 32 bits = generation. `…Id{0}` reserved as invalid.

**Out of scope**: streaming (AU3), 3D (AU4).

## Batch AU3 — Streaming audio ✅ landed 2026-06-10

**Goal**: `IAudioStream` interface and the mixer's streaming voice
path, fed by synthetic test streams that yield known bytes.

**Test gate** (all green on `build/` + `build-werror/`):

- ✅ `test_audio_stream_basic` — register an infinite noise stream,
  play it, mix 10 seconds at 48kHz; stream cursor matches
  `calls × bufferFrames`; peak above silence; no underruns.
- ✅ `test_audio_stream_rewind` — finite 1024-frame stream consumed
  by two mix calls, voice auto-stops on the next; `rewind()`
  resets cursor and clears `finished()`; re-play after rewind
  works cleanly.
- ✅ `test_audio_stream_underrun` — `StarvedStream` returns half
  the requested frames per call; underrun counter bumps once per
  short read; first half of captured buffer holds the producer's
  payload, second half is silence; voice keeps playing.
- ✅ `test_audio_stream_loop` — looping voice on a 384-frame stream
  with 256-frame mixer: rewind happens transparently inside the
  mix call, no zero-filled tail, no underruns counted.

**Files landed**:
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/stream.hpp` — `IAudioStream` interface
  + `NoiseStream` + `StarvedStream` test producers
- `VoiceDesc` / `VoiceSlot` gained `StreamId stream{}` +
  `bool isStream` for stream-vs-clip dispatch
- `AudioMixer` gained `addStream` / `removeStream` /
  `isValidStream`; `AudioMixerConfig::maxStreams = 16`
- `mix()` factored a shared `mixFramesIntoBus` helper and added
  the stream voice path with transparent rewind on looping +
  underrun-fill behavior
- `MixerStats::underruns` is now wired
- four `tests/audio/test_audio_stream_*.cpp`

**Resolved decisions**:
- Streams are read-on-mixer-thread for v1.0 — threaded prefetch
  is v1.x territory.
- A stream may be shared across voices only with explicit
  game-side ownership; the mixer doesn't guard against concurrent
  reads on the same stream (one voice per stream is the
  recommended pattern).
- EOF + looping: the mixer rewinds inside the read path so the
  output buffer is contiguous; producer underrun (short read
  WITHOUT `finished()`) fills the tail with silence and increments
  the counter.
- Stream channel adaptation uses the same down-mix / mono-fanout
  policy as clips.

**Out of scope**: codec decoders (Ogg/FLAC/Opus). Game-side
responsibility — this library exposes the stream interface and
ships synthetic test streams, not real decoders.

## Batch AU4 — 3D spatialization ✅ landed 2026-06-10

**Goal**: listener / emitter state, distance attenuation, stereo
panning by listener-relative angle, and Doppler pitch shift.

**Test gate** (all green on `build/` + `build-werror/`):

- ✅ `test_audio_spatial_attenuation` — `Linear` model: emitter at
  `minDistance` → full gain; at midpoint → ~0.5; at and beyond
  `maxDistance` → silence.
- ✅ `test_audio_spatial_pan` — emitter to listener's left → L-only
  output; to the right → R-only; directly in front → equal-power
  center; directly behind → equal-power center with documented
  ~0.7× behind attenuation.
- ✅ `test_audio_spatial_doppler` — zero-crossing counts on a 440 Hz
  sine confirm pitch shift: stationary matches expected count to
  within 10; listener at +34.3 m/s towards emitter raises the
  count by 5-15%; listener moving away drops it by 5-15%.
- ✅ `test_audio_spatial_multiple_listeners` — two listeners each
  produce independent attenuation: same emitter, voice on L1 →
  audible, voice on L2 (far) → silent; moving L2 close → audible.

**Files landed**:
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/spatial.hpp` — `Vec3`,
  `AttenuationModel`, `ListenerDesc`, `EmitterDesc`,
  `kSpeedOfSound = 343.0f`
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/detail/pan_law.hpp` — header-only
  spatializer math: `computeAttenuation` + `computeSpatial` +
  Vec3 helpers; produces `SpatialResult { gainL, gainR,
  pitchShift }`
- `AudioMixer` gained `createListener` / `destroyListener` /
  `setListener` / `isValidListener` plus `setEmitter` /
  `clearEmitter`; `AudioMixerConfig::maxListeners = 4`
- `VoiceSlot` gained `isSpatial` + `listener` + `emitter` +
  `playheadFrames` widened to `double` (Doppler needs fractional
  cursor advance)
- Mixer `mix()` dispatches spatial clip voices through
  `mixSpatialClipVoiceInto` (mono down-mix + L/R apply + pitch-
  shifted source read)
- four `tests/audio/test_audio_spatial_*.cpp`

**Resolved decisions**:
- Right-handed +Z-forward / +Y-up coordinate system;
  `right = up × forward`.
- Equal-power pan via `(panX + 1) · π/4` → cos / sin.
- Behind attenuation linear in `frontness`: 1.0 in front, 0.7 when
  fully behind.
- Doppler formula `f' = f · (c + v_listener_toward) /
  (c + v_emitter_away)`; `dopplerFactor=0` disables; pitch shift
  clamped at ≥ 0.01 to guard against pathological velocities.
- Clip voices can be spatial; stream voices stay non-spatial in
  v1.0 (extension hook is there if needed). Channel layouts other
  than stereo bus get the L/R sum spread evenly.

**Out of scope**: HRTF / binaural rendering (v1.x), reverb
(v1.x), occlusion (v1.x).

## Batch AU5 — DSP helpers ✅ landed 2026-06-10

**Goal**: gain / pan / fade-in / fade-out as standalone span ops
(per DESIGN_NOTES §5.4). Header-only; usable both internally and
in custom DSP chains.

**Test gate** (all green on `build/` + `build-werror/`):

- ✅ `test_audio_dsp_gain` — `applyGain(buf, 0dB)` is bit-exact no-op
  (× 1.0 in IEEE-754); `applyGain(buf, -∞dB)` silences every
  sample; `-6dB` halves amplitude within 1e-4 tolerance.
- ✅ `test_audio_dsp_pan` — `applyPanStereo` at -1 produces L-only
  output; 0 produces equal-power center (`L = R = src × √2/2`);
  +1 produces R-only; mono buffers are a no-op.
- ✅ `test_audio_dsp_fade` — both fade directions verified:
  monotonic envelopes, sample[0] / sample[N*rate-1] hit the
  expected endpoints, samples past the fade region clamp to the
  target gain; zero-seconds and negative-rate are silent no-ops.
- ✅ `test_audio_dsp_no_allocations` — 64 chained
  gain/pan/fadeIn/fadeOut passes over a stereo span produce zero
  heap traffic under the tracking allocator.

**Files landed**:
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/dsp.hpp` — header-only `applyGain`,
  `applyPanStereo`, `applyFadeIn`, `applyFadeOut`
- four `tests/audio/test_audio_dsp_*.cpp`

**Resolved decisions**:
- Stereo pan: equal-power, same `(pan+1)·π/4` mapping as the
  spatializer in AU4.
- Fade envelopes: linear, denominator `fadeFrames - 1` so the last
  in-range sample hits the target exactly. Fades shorter than 2
  frames are no-ops (degenerate input).
- 0 dB is bit-exact identity — early-out path skips the multiply
  loop entirely.

**Out of scope**: filters (lowpass/highpass/EQ) — v1.x.

## Batch AU6 — Diagnostics + events ✅ landed 2026-06-11

**Goal**: peak/RMS meters wired into `MixerStats`,
`AudioDiagnostics` view wrapper, playback event callback.

**Test gate** (all green on `build/` + `build-werror/`):

- ✅ `test_audio_diagnostics_meters` — DC clip at 1.0 amplitude
  drives `peakL` / `peakR` / `rmsL` / `rmsR` all within 1e-3 of
  1.0 after one mix; switching to a quieter clip keeps peak (hold-
  max) while RMS tracks the current buffer.
- ✅ `test_audio_diagnostics_reset` — `resetPeaks()` zeroes the
  peak meters but preserves the cumulative `underruns` counter;
  subsequent mix re-populates peaks from the still-playing voice.
- ✅ `test_audio_events_playback` — VoiceStarted fires immediately
  on `play()`; VoiceLooped fires once per mix call where the clip
  wraps; VoiceStopped fires on both explicit `stop()` and mix-time
  auto-stop; clearing the callback with `nullptr` silences events.

**Files landed**:
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/events.hpp` — `PlaybackEventType`,
  `PlaybackEvent`, `PlaybackEventCallback` (C function pointer +
  user-data to avoid hidden `std::function` allocations)
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/diagnostics.hpp` — `AudioDiagnostics`
  non-owning view wrapper
- `AudioMixer::setPlaybackEventCallback`; peaks wired in mix()
  end-of-buffer; `resetPeaks()` implementation; `mixClipVoiceInto`
  / `mixSpatialClipVoiceInto` gained a `looped` out-param so the
  mixer can emit `VoiceLooped`
- three `tests/audio/test_audio_(diagnostics|events)_*.cpp`

**Resolved decisions**:
- `peakL` / `peakR` are hold-max (lifetime since last
  `resetPeaks()`); `rmsL` / `rmsR` are per-call instantaneous (RMS
  over a single buffer).
- Mono buses mirror the single channel into both L/R fields so
  consumers can read a single set of numbers regardless of layout.
- Voice stealing does NOT emit `VoiceStopped` for the displaced
  voice — the slot's generation is already bumped before the
  callback could fire. Use the `droppedVoices` counter for steal
  observability.
- Callback signature is a C-style function pointer + user-data
  (not `std::function`) to keep the hot path zero-alloc.

**Out of scope**: spectrum analysis, capture-to-file.

## Batch AU7 — Engine integration ✅ landed 2026-06-11

**Goal**: a recommended `ISystem` pattern that reads `Transform`
chunks and updates listener / emitter state. The library stays
engine-agnostic per DESIGN_NOTES §2.1 — only `scene.hpp`'s thin
one-line wrappers ship in the library; the integration glue lives
in the smoke test and the example.

**Test gate** (green on `build/` + `build-werror/`):

- ✅ `test_audio_engine_integration` — Engine + AudioMixer + sample
  `AudioSystem` ISystem. Tracks (entity, voice) pairs; reads
  Transform via `ctx.worldView().world()->tryGetTransform()` in
  postStep and calls `setEmitterPose`; calls `mixer.mix()` to close
  the tick. A second-tick TeleportSystem writes a new Transform via
  `cb.setTransform`; AudioSystem sees the committed value the same
  tick (registration order). Verified by peak amplitude collapsing
  near→far.
- ✅ `bench/audio_crowd_bench.cpp` — 256 voices on 4 buses, 1024-
  frame buffers @ 48 kHz, 2000 iterations: **0.139 ms/buffer**
  (avg 0.54 µs/voice). v1.0 close-out gate was < 2 ms/buffer — we
  cleared it by ~14×.

**Performance fix during this batch**: the original
`mixClipVoiceInto` called `mixFramesIntoBus` once per output frame,
which blocked vectorisation and turned the bench in at 4.5 ms/256
voices. Rewrote to segmented mixing (one contiguous run per
clip-wrap chunk) + specialised stereo→stereo / mono→stereo fast
paths inside `mixFramesIntoBus`; the compiler now vectorises the
inner loop. Same correctness (24/24 audio tests still green).

**Files landed**:
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/scene.hpp` — `setListenerPose` /
  `setEmitterPose` one-line wrappers
- `tests/audio/test_audio_engine_integration.cpp` (links both
  `threadmaxx::audio` and `threadmaxx::threadmaxx`, gated on the
  core target being available)
- `bench/audio_crowd_bench.cpp` (opt-in via
  `THREADMAXX_BUILD_BENCHMARKS`; gated on `threadmaxx::audio`)
- `examples/audio_demo/` (headless integration walkthrough using
  `LoopbackDevice`; reads back the peak meter)
- Mixer hot-path perf rewrite in `AudioMixer.cpp`

**Resolved decisions**:
- `scene.hpp` is engine-agnostic — game code converts its own
  `Transform` to `audio::Vec3` at the call site (one struct-init
  line). The library never names a threadmaxx core type.
- AudioSystem reads positions in `postStep` so it sees Transforms
  committed by writers earlier in the registration order during
  the same tick.
- Bench gate phrasing changed from "audible-amplitude assertion"
  to a numeric ms/buffer report so v1.0 close-out can quote it.

**Out of scope**: the full RPG demo audio integration (lives in
GAME_EXTENSION.md's mid-term tranche, depends on this library).

## Batch AU8 — Platform backends (Linux first) ✅ landed 2026-06-11

**Goal**: ship `AlsaDevice` and `PulseDevice` so the library is
usable end-to-end on the Linux dev target. CMake's `find_package`
gates each one; missing libs silently skip the backend so the
build still succeeds.

**Test gate** (green on `build/` + `build-werror/`):

- ✅ `test_audio_backend_alsa` — built when CMake found ALSA at
  configure time (otherwise compiles to a `printf` + PASS). Boots
  the "default" PCM, submits one buffer of silence, shuts down,
  re-initializes, drops a post-shutdown submit silently. Booted
  cleanly on the dev target (~0.28 s for the drain).
- ✅ `test_audio_backend_pulse` — same shape, gated on
  libpulse-simple via `pkg_check_modules`. Boots a pulse playback
  stream and round-trips identically.

**Files landed**:
- `include/threadmaxx_audio/alsa_device.hpp` /
  `pulse_device.hpp` — PImpl'd public headers so consumers don't
  pull `<alsa/asoundlib.h>` or `<pulse/simple.h>` into every TU
- `src/threadmaxx_audio/backends/AlsaDevice.cpp` — `snd_pcm_open`
  on "default", interleaved float32 LE, 100 ms target latency,
  `snd_pcm_recover` on transient xrun
- `src/threadmaxx_audio/backends/PulseDevice.cpp` —
  `pa_simple_new` + `pa_simple_write`, default server / device,
  PA_SAMPLE_FLOAT32LE
- CMake gating in `src/threadmaxx_audio/CMakeLists.txt` via
  `find_package(ALSA)` + `pkg_check_modules(libpulse-simple)`;
  defines `THREADMAXX_AUDIO_HAS_ALSA=1` / `…_HAS_PULSE=1` when
  available
- `tests/audio/test_audio_backend_alsa.cpp` /
  `test_audio_backend_pulse.cpp` — both tolerant: `init()`
  returning false (no device / no daemon) is a PASS so the suite
  stays green on headless CI

**Resolved decisions**:
- Fallback chain is **caller-side**: games construct in priority
  order (`AlsaDevice` → `PulseDevice` → `LoopbackDevice`) and use
  the first one that `initialize()`s. The library doesn't ship a
  "smart" wrapper because that policy is game-specific.
- ALSA is opened on "default" (the user's `~/.asoundrc` /
  `/etc/asound.conf` resolution applies); pulse is opened with
  default server + default device. No knobs in the v1.0 surface.
- Buffer-frame parameter is recorded but not enforced: ALSA picks
  its own period size; the mixer's `bufferFrames` is independent.

**Out of scope**: macOS CoreAudio, Windows WASAPI, JACK. Add when
the project targets those platforms.

## v1.0 close-out criteria ✅ all green 2026-06-11

- ✅ Every batch AU1–AU8 landed and tested.
- ✅ Voice pool tested up to 256 simultaneously-playing voices
  without allocation (`test_audio_voice_pool_256_no_alloc`,
  100 mix cycles under tracking allocator, zero heap traffic).
- ✅ ALSA backend boots on the dev target
  (`test_audio_backend_alsa` PASS on Linux x86_64).
- ✅ Bench `audio_crowd_bench` reports **0.140 ms / buffer** at
  256 voices / 4 buses / 1024 frames @ 48 kHz — ~14× under the
  2 ms gate.
- ✅ Docs: `README.md`, `USER_GUIDE.md`, `MAINTAINER_GUIDE.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md` all landed under `include/threadmaxx_audio/`.
- ✅ ctest 100% on `build/` AND `build-werror/`
  (`-Wsign-conversion -Wconversion -Wold-style-cast -Werror`) —
  27/27 audio tests.
- ✅ Version stamped at 1.0.0 in
  `include/threadmaxx_audio/version.hpp` —
  `THREADMAXX_AUDIO_VERSION = 10000`, `version_string() = "1.0.0"`.

## v1.x candidate batches (not blocking v1.0)

### v1.x — Filter chain (lowpass / highpass / EQ)

Per-voice and per-bus filter slots. Biquad implementation;
coefficient computation already well-documented (RBJ cookbook).
Bench gate: 256-voice mix with 1-band EQ per voice must stay
under 4ms per 1024-frame buffer.

### v1.x — Reverb send bus

Schroeder or freeverb-style algorithmic reverb on a dedicated send
bus. Optional per-voice send level.

### v1.x — HRTF / binaural rendering

For VR / headphone targets. Per-listener convolution against
shipped HRTF impulse-response sets. Significant CPU cost; gate it
hard behind a config flag.

### v1.x — Codec adapters

Optional `IAudioStream` adapters for Ogg Vorbis (via libvorbis) and
Opus (via libopus). Ship as separate optional CMake targets.

### v1.x — Backend: CoreAudio / WASAPI / JACK

Add when the project targets those platforms. Templates from the
existing ALSA/Pulse backends apply.

### v1.x — Capture-to-WAV diagnostic mode

A `CaptureDevice` decorator that writes the submitted mix buffer
to a WAV file. Invaluable for debugging mix issues offline.

### v1.x — SIMD-accelerated mixer

Per-voice gain + mix-into-bus is the obvious vector target.
8-channel `__m256` mix at FMA rate. Bench gate: ≥2× over scalar at
256-voice load.

## Out of scope for the whole library

Per DESIGN_NOTES §1 — none of this lands at any batch:

- Physics simulation / collision authority
- Animation graph ownership
- Navmesh logic
- Rendering backend
- Networking stack
- Editor UI
- ECS storage model
- Asset format ownership (game owns its codecs)
- Hidden engine-side audio state
